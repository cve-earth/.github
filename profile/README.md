# cve.earth

Tech rules the world. In no other sector has the pace of advancement been as rapid as in the software industry. This is partly due to the fact that we, as software developers, have perfected the proces with which to improve, secure and develop software.

What if we used some of those tools and concepts to debug our beloved planet?

## Intro

cve.earth exists to ask the question "What if we treated pollution as a bug or security vulnerability?".

This industry has designed mechanisms (CVE®[^1]) to publicly hold to account companies that leave our data open for exploitation. The goal of this project is to adapt the same mechanisms to hold corporations to account for their part in climate catastrophe.

## Goals
- Adapt concepts from traditional cybersecurity CVE (translation layer between software <=> environment contexts)
- Develop a framework for Environmental Vulnerability Disclosures (a github issue template)
- Develop a database of disclosures (GH Action that submits issue-based disclosures into a DB)
- Educate and encourage the public/audit firms/corporations to submit actionable, impactful & specific EVDs
- Track and record EVD resolutions
