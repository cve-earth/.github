# CVE.Earth

In today's digital world, technology has an immense influence. The software industry, in particular, has advanced at a remarkable pace, largely due to our proficiency in improving, securing, and developing software.

What if we could apply these same tools and concepts to 'debug' our beloved planet?

## Introduction

CVE.Earth exists to ponder and act upon the question: "What if we treated pollution and environmental harm as bugs or security vulnerabilities?"

The tech industry has designed effective mechanisms, such as CVE®[^1], to publicly hold companies accountable for leaving our data exposed to potential exploitation. Our goal with this project is to adapt these mechanisms, traditionally utilized in the realm of cybersecurity, to hold corporations accountable for their contributions to the climate crisis.

## Goals

- **Adapt concepts from traditional cybersecurity CVE:** We aim to create a translation layer between software and environmental contexts, adapting strategies from cybersecurity to environmental preservation.

- **Develop a framework for Environmental Vulnerability Disclosures:** We're building a GitHub issue template for EVDs to standardize the reporting process.

- **Develop a database of disclosures:** A GitHub Action will be used to submit issue-based disclosures into a database, forming a comprehensive record of reported environmental vulnerabilities.

- **Educate and encourage submissions:** We strive to educate the public, audit firms, and corporations to submit actionable, impactful, and specific EVDs, thereby fostering a proactive culture of environmental accountability.

- **Track and record EVD resolutions:** We will keep track of EVD resolutions to ensure accountability and facilitate progress tracking.

## Disclosures Repository

Our [Disclosures Repository](https://github.com/cve-earth/disclosures) serves as a central hub for reporting and tracking corporate environmental vulnerabilities. It allows for open, transparent reporting and fosters a community-driven effort to hold corporations accountable for their environmental impact.

### How to Use

The process for reporting an environmental vulnerability is simple and straightforward:

1. Visit the [Disclosures Repository](https://github.com/cve-earth/disclosures/issues/new/choose).
2. Click on "New issue", and select the "Environmental Vulnerability Disclosure" option.
3. Fill in the provided template with as much detail as possible. The more information you can provide, the better.
4. Once you're done, click "Submit new issue". Your disclosure will now be publicly accessible and open for discussion and investigation.

By submitting a disclosure, you're helping to shed light on environmental harm and driving accountability. Every contribution, no matter how small, brings us one step closer to a more sustainable future.
