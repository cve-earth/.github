# CVE.Earth

In today's digital world, technology has an immense influence. The software industry, in particular, has advanced at a remarkable pace, largely due to our proficiency in improving, securing, and developing software.

What if we could apply these same tools and concepts to 'debug' our beloved planet?

## Introduction

CVE.Earth exists to ponder and act upon the question: "What if we treated pollution and environmental harm as bugs or security vulnerabilities?"

The tech industry has designed effective mechanisms, such as CVE®[^1], to publicly hold companies accountable for leaving our data exposed to potential exploitation. Our goal with this project is to adapt these mechanisms, traditionally utilized in the realm of cybersecurity, to hold corporations accountable for their contributions to the climate crisis.

## Goals

- **Adapt concepts from traditional cybersecurity CVE:** We aim to create a translation layer between software and environmental contexts, adapting strategies from cybersecurity to environmental preservation.

- **Develop a framework for Environmental Vulnerability Disclosures:** We're building a GitHub issue template for EVDs to standardize the reporting process.

- **Develop a database of disclosures:** A GitHub Action will be used to submit issue-based disclosures into a database, forming a comprehensive record of reported environmental vulnerabilities.

- **Educate and encourage submissions:** We strive to educate the public, audit firms, and corporations to submit actionable, impactful, and specific EVDs, thereby fostering a proactive culture of environmental accountability.

- **Track and record EVD resolutions:** We will keep track of EVD resolutions to ensure accountability and facilitate progress tracking.
